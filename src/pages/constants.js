Because let's face it, nothing screams excitement like sitting in front of a screen all day and then coming back to read more words on a page. But fear not, dear reader, for you'll have plenty of time to enjoy those books once you're done debugging that code that's been driving you up the wall."

You're a developer, after all, you know how to make things happen. Now get reading, and don't forget to come up for air once in a while, we don't want you getting too lost in those pages!";
